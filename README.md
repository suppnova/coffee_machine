A coffee machine simulator. 

The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification and you need to fill the supplies. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothingâ€™s for free, it also collects the money. Another special worker is able to take out money from the coffee machine.
